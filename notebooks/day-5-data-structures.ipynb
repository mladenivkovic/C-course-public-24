    "Implement a program that stores numbers in a linked list and then prints them out. The nodes of your linked list should be an appropriate struct type and should be dynamically allocated using `malloc()`. The program should let the user input numbers at runtime and should contain a function that adds nodes to the end of the list. (Note that pressing `Ctrl+D` at the terminal makes `scanf()` return EOF. In the notebook, enter \"^D\" and press return to end user input.)\n",
